# AI Flight Recommendations Demo

## Overview
The AI Flight Recommendations system provides intelligent route optimization based on real-time weather data, aircraft capabilities, and multiple safety factors. This system analyzes alternative routes and provides detailed explanations for each recommendation.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Analysis
- **Multi-factor scoring**: Safety, efficiency, and comfort scores
- **Aircraft-specific optimization**: Different recommendations for different aircraft types
- **Real-time weather integration**: Uses actual turbulence and weather data
- **Confidence scoring**: Each recommendation includes a confidence level

### ðŸŽ¯ Priority-Based Recommendations
- **Safety First**: Prioritizes turbulence avoidance and weather hazards
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Optimizes for fuel savings and route efficiency
- **Passenger Comfort**: Minimizes passenger discomfort and turbulence exposure
- **Balanced**: Combines all factors for optimal overall performance

### ðŸ“Š Detailed Explanations
Each recommendation includes:
- Safety improvement percentage
- Time penalty vs. fuel savings
- Weather hazards avoided
- Confidence level in the recommendation

## How to Use

### 1. Access the AI Recommendations Panel
- Navigate to the Aviation Dashboard
- Scroll down to the "AI Flight Recommendations" section
- The panel will automatically load with sample data

### 2. Configure Your Preferences
- **Aircraft Type**: Select your aircraft (B737, B777, A320, A350, CRJ)
- **Priority**: Choose your optimization priority
- **Generate**: Click "Generate Recommendations" to analyze routes

### 3. Review Recommendations
- Each recommendation shows safety, efficiency, and comfort scores
- Click on any recommendation to see detailed explanations
- Use the "Use This Route" button to select a recommended route

## Sample Data

The demo uses a sample flight route:
- **Origin**: JFK (New York)
- **Destination**: LAX (Los Angeles)
- **Current Position**: Mid-flight over Kansas
- **Aircraft**: Boeing 737

## API Endpoint

The AI recommendations are powered by the `/api/ai-recommendations` endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/ai-recommendations
{
  "route": {
    "origin": { "lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060, "name": "JFK", "icao": "KJFK" },
    "destination": { "lat": 34.0522, "lng": -118.2437, "name": "LAX", "icao": "KLAX" },
    "currentPosition": { "lat": 37.0902, "lng": -95.7129, "altitude": 35000, "timestamp": 1234567890 }
  },
  "aircraftType": "B737",
  "priority": "balanced",
  "includeTurbulenceData": true
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### AI Recommendation Engine
- **Route Alternatives**: Generates altitude variations, lateral deviations, and optimized waypoints
